# voicebot
This is a Discord bot implemented with Node.js that uses the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to implement voice commands in a Discord server. The bot also includes miscellaneous commands related to audio streaming, such as the ability to play the audio of a Youtube video or audio file in a voice channel.

The bot requires a valid google-credentials.json file and this file must be referenced in the appropriate environment variable. An in depth explanation of what to do can be found [here.](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/libraries#cloud-console)
